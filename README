ofxTweakbar
===========
AntTweakbar addon for openFrameworks. AntTweakbar is a clean, small and simple
GUI system designed to tweak parameters. This is a must have GUI when you need
to tweak certain parameters in your app. The addon is designed to be as clear
and versatile as possible.


Compiling AntTweakbar on MacOS (static lib)
============================================
Copy the Makefile.osx in the src directory of AntTweakbar to Makefile

Change lines to this: (just check the variables)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SO_EXT		= .a
CXXCFG   	= -O3 -arch i386 -arch x86_64 
LFLAGS		= -arch i386 -arch x86_64 

At the bottom change this:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	@echo "====== Archive $@ ==========="
	$(AR) $(OUT_DIR)/lib$(TARGET)$(SO_EXT) $(OBJS)


I've put the Makefile in the "doc" directory.
